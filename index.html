    <!--React only manipulate code inside root if anything above it or lower it react will not touch it
    So basically div1 will work frst then div2 then div 3
    then core React CDN link bring things , then DOM link will work then App.js code will come 
    which will replace all the code in root
    So Inside Root will get printed but got replaced by code of App.js
    So basically since React is an LIBRARY its affecting only a small part -->
    <!-- <div>Above Root</div> -->
    <div id="root">
        <!-- <div>Inside Root</div> -->
    </div>
    <!-- <div>Below Root</div> -->

    <!--These links are CDN React links used to bring react inside our normal project -->
    <!-- this one is for core react -->
     <!--No need to bring react through CDN links , always go with npm i-->

    <!-- <script crossorigin 
    src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script> -->

    <!-- this one is for react for browser (DOM) -->

    <!-- <script crossorigin
     src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script> -->

     <!--Can we change the order of script  A BIG NO 
     frst we need to bring the core features of React , then the features related to browser
     then only we can put the code of React-->
     <!--if we didn't add type='module' , browser will treat it as normal js file which will not support import or export
     statement so we cannot import React in our app-->
    <script type='module' src="./App.js">
    </script>
